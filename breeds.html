                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 10 – 17 years<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Male: 30–45 lbs (14–20 Kg), Female: 27–42 lbs (12–19 Kg)<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Tenacious, Keen, Energetic, Responsive, Alert, Intelligent<br><strong>Colors:</strong> Blue Merle, White, Black, Blue, Lilac, Brindle, Red Merle, Dark Brown, Chocolate, Tan, Sable Merle, Sable, Gold<br><strong>Height:</strong> Male: 19–22 inches (48–56 cm), Female: 18–21 inches (46–53 cm)<br><strong>Origin:</strong> Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, England, Wales</p>
                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Border Collie prefers to move close to the human being, creating a very close bond. The breed of Border Collies is considered friendly, cuddly and fond of children. Well balanced, they always meet their environment curious and open-minded. By nature, the Border Collie shows no aggressive behavior, but its great sensitivity and intelligence can lead to nervous or even aggressive behavior in low employment or basically wrong education. Since this dog breed is a workhorse, it also wants to be physically and mentally challenged accordingly. The Border Collie learns eagerly and quickly. He also acts courageously, can independently identify and solve problems. A Border Collie always has his reference person in view and tries to "guard" it. Therefore, to ensure a peaceful coexistence, it is important to maintain a stable ranking. Owners should also treat the animal to rest, because the "Border" wants to play because of his character even when he is already exhausted.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>Der Border Collie stammt ursprünglich aus dem schottisch-englischen Grenzland, was auch zu seinem Namen führte (engl. border = Grenze). Ein Hund namens „Old Hemp“ gilt als Stammvater der heutigen Border Collies. Das Tier zeichnete sich durch außergewöhnlich gute Hütefähigkeiten aus, deshalb gilt er als bedeutendster Zuchtrüde. Erste Aufzeichnungen über diese Rasse sind über 2.000 Jahre alt. Zu dieser Zeit fielen die Römer in Britannien ein und brachten frühe Formen des Border Collies auf das europäische Festland mit. Die Arbeitsweise der Border Collies nach heutiger Definition wird erstmalig im Buch "Treatise on Englische Doggess" festgehalten, welches im Jahr 1570 von John Caius publiziert wurde. Vom kynologischen Dachverband Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) wird der Border Collie seit 1976 anerkannt. Im Jahr 1978 erfolgte die erste Eintragung eines Border Collies in das Zuchtbuch des Clubs für Britische Hütehunde. In Deutschland verbreiteten sich Border Collies mit Beginn der 1970er Jahre.</p>

                        <p><strong>Hypoallergenic:</strong> No<br><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 12 – 15 years<br><strong>Origin:</strong> China<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Docile, Clever, Charming, Stubborn, Sociable, Playful, Quiet, Attentive<br><strong>Colors:</strong> Black, Fawn, Silver Fawn, Apricot<br><strong>Height:</strong> Male: 12 in.

                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The pug is generally credited with a well-balanced, cheerful and lively character. He is considered uncomplicated, charming, dignified and intelligent. These properties should have contributed significantly to its great popularity and widespread use. Pugs are brave and tend to underestimate dangerous situations. Aggressive behavior is atypical for her as well as excessive anxiety, but both are considered as a disqualifying mistake in breeding - similar to other behavioral disorders and physical deviations.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>Although the exact origin of the breed is unclear, there is a broad consensus that the pug comes from China. The breeding of small, short-haired dogs with large heads as well as shortened catch has a long tradition in China, and as early as the ninth century there was a dog breed known as Lo-chi-ang-sze or Lo-sze. It is not known exactly how the pug got to Europe. What is certain, however, is that since the beginning of the 15th century evidence of its existence in Europe can be found, such as a drawing by Pisanello. At first, holding pugs was considered a luxury, confined primarily to royal courts and families of the nobility or the upper bourgeoisie. Especially in the 18th In the 19th century, the pug flourished and was painted or modeled countless times, but in the 19th century it was followed by a decline that nearly made the breed disappear in Europe. However, especially in England, the pug was bred and revived as a breed by new imports from Russia, Holland and China. Interestingly, in Europe initially only light-colored boobs were known, only in 1877 introduced a first black couple from the Orient.</p>

                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Beagle is clearly characteristically and characteristically shaped by his breeding past as a dog. He follows the dynamics of his pack and likes to adapt to his peculiarities. This pronounced social component makes the Beagle a popular family dog. The Beagle is a kid-friendly dog ​​breed, happy and always ready to play. With his environment he cares for a harmonious and gentle handling. Nevertheless, he is very vigilant and unrelentingly reports unrelenting to his pack.</p><p>However, the Beagle has always been a hunting dog and will take the opportunity to pursue its passion. Once he has picked up a track, he can hardly retrieve from it. In this respect, it is up to the owner, whether he leaves his dog on a leash or let him play on the dog meadow and romp around.</p><p>This goal-directedness of the beagle, which manifests itself, for example, when tracking a trail, can also be understood as stubbornness. However, it does not diminish its high level of intelligence and friendliness. However, it is important to be able to handle this property consistently. In addition, this characteristic of the Beagles has its positive ability to act very independently and smartly in challenging situations as well as to prove an excellent problem-solving competence.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>The Beagle in its present form comes from England, where it was bred as a hunting dog for smaller game to be tracked down. His ancestors seem to have lived around 1400 in southern France. Medium sized, chasing tirelessly and with a very good sense of smell, these speckled and piebald dogs impressed the British so much during the Hundred Years War that they took them away and also used them for hunting. This breed was called Southern Hounds.</p><p>The first mention of the Beagle, whose exact name origin is unclear, appears in 1515 in the household books of Henry VIII. There, a so-called "Keeper of the Beagles" is rewarded. In 1615, the Little Beagle finds its way into Gervase Markham's general description of the main hunting breeds. However, it lasted until 1890, when the beagle was recognized as a separate breed of dog by the English Kennel Club.</p>
