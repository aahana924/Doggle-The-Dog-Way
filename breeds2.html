                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 12 – 15 years<br><strong>Origin:</strong> Siberia<br><strong>Colors:</strong> White, Black, Agouti, Piebald, Copper, Black &amp; Gold, Blue Belton, Splash, Silver, Sable, Brown<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Outgoing, Friendly, Alert, Gentle, Intelligent<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Female: 16–23 Kg, Male: 20–27 Kg<br><strong>Height:</strong> Female: 50–56 cm, Male: 54–60 cm</p>
                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Siberian Husky has retained its very original character to this day, which distinguishes him clearly from the classic family and companion dogs. He is still a strong pack animal, which needs constant employment and society. He only builds a close bond with his owner if he provides him with the attention he needs. In a species-appropriate attitude, he turns out to be a very philanthropic, enterprising and affectionate dog.</p><p>The Siberian Husky has an exceptionally strong urge to move and would like to walk extensively every day. The unbridled drive and independence make it difficult to permanently control a Siberian Husky and its innate hunting instinct. If kept out of action and sufficiently moved, the Siberian Husky is still a carefree and loving dog that can handle strangers well and adapt to any new situation.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>As the name suggests, the Siberian Husky comes from Siberia, where he was used as a draft and work animal already about 2000 years ago. Due to the isolation of the nomadic tribes, who used the Siberian Husky, the breeding of the breed remained pure for a long time. Until the beginning of the 20th century, a Russian fur trader discovered the adaptable dogs and brought them to Alaska. There dog sled races were popular at that time, so that the Siberian newcomers soon enjoyed great popularity. Despite its excellent characteristics and centuries of pure breeding, the breed was first recognized in the USA in 1930 and in Europe in 1966.</p>

                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Life span:</strong> 10 – 12 years<br><strong>Colors:</strong> Cream, Golden, Dark Golden, Light Golden<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Intelligent, Kind, Reliable, Friendly, Trustworthy, Confident<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Female: 25–32 Kg, Male: 30–34 Kg<br><strong>Height:</strong> Female: 51–56 cm, Male: 56–61 cm<br><strong>Did you know:</strong> Golden Retriever is the fifth-most popular dog breed by registrations (92,994) worldwide.</p>
                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Golden Retriever was a hunting companion to his breeding, which should be used in common with other dogs. This explains its compatibility with conspecifics and its generally gentle, harmonious nature. In addition, he is a resilient and agile dog whose species-specific urge to move is to satisfy. With empathetic and competent upbringing, the Golden Retriever is a balanced and peaceful companion who can best be led as a family dog.</p><p>His family suitability is strengthened by the pronounced inclination to please his pack leader ("will to please"), which on the one hand shows a high degree of attention and on the other hand leads to a pronounced ease. However, this does not make the Golden Retriever a pure submissive dog. He is very spirited and playful until older age, also adaptable and rudelbewusst.</p><p>The Golden Retriever can live well with children of all ages due to his balanced, cheerful nature and his unshakeable serenity. He fits easily into his assigned place within the human ripple, as long as it fully integrates him and takes into account his needs.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>It has been proven that all retriever breeds originate from Newfoundland. In the 19th century, the weatherproof dogs of the island impressed English sailors with their zest for water and their desire to retrieve the rafts. Already at that time, the dogs' abilities were used for recovery and detection.</p><p>A number of the dogs returned to England with the sailors, where they were referred to as "Little Newfoundlands" and "St. John's Dogs" and crossed with English hunting dogs. Such a mix was called "Wavy-Coated Retriever". In 1864, the English lord Tweedmouth bought a Wavy-Coated Retriever named "Nous" with a fancy yellow color and paired him with a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch - a breed with equally strong appetite and good stamina.</p><p>This started a longer breeding experiment with these two breeds, into which later the breed of Irish Setter was crossed. Within 20 years, the current "Golden Retriever" developed as a working dog in the hunt, whose primary tasks were the detection and retrieval of shot wild. In 1903, the British Kennel Club recognized the Golden Retriever as a breed.</p>

                           <p>The Shiba Inu is one of the 6 original Japanese Spitzhundrassen and was originally used in the hunt for small game and birds.

Many of these dogs were crossed in originally Japanese breeds. Beginning in 1928, the Shiba Inu was started to breed and in 1934 the first breed standards were established. Since 1937, Shiba Inu has been under special protection as a "national cultural asset" in Japan. The term Shiba Inu also comes from the Japanese; where "Inu" just means "dog"</p>
