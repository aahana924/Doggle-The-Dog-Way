                     <p><strong>Speed:</strong> 70 km/h (Maximum, Race speed)<br><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 10 – 12 years<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Affectionate, Athletic, Gentle, Intelligent, Quiet, Even Tempered<br><strong>Height:</strong> Male: 71–76 cm, Female: 68–71 cm<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Male: 27–40 Kg, Female: 26–34 Kg<br><strong>Origin:</strong> England, British Isles</p>
                     <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                     <p>As the world's fastest dog, the Greyhound has fascinated people for centuries with its suppleness, elegance and physical strength. He is still an unsurpassed racing dog, which can reach speeds of up to 100 Kmph. But even as family dogs make these greyhounds a good figure. Here, they prove their frugality on a daily basis and blend harmoniously into the family environment with their gentle, sensitive and affectionate manner.</p>
                     <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                     <p>The Greyhound has been bred in England for centuries according to a set breed standard and was previously used in both hunting and racing. Originally, the Greyhound probably came from the Middle East, where more than 6,000-year-old drawings of similar dogs in Egyptian tombs were discovered. He arrived in Great Britain in the 4th century BC. As a companion dog Celtic immigrants and quickly became a favorite animal of the nobility. The Greyhound has been used in England since the mid-16th century for races that take place both on the track and on the open field.</p>

                     <h4>Facts:</h4>
                     <p><strong>Hypoallergenic:</strong> No<br><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 12 – 20 years<br><strong>Origin:</strong> Mexico<br><strong>Mass:</strong> 3.3 – 6.6 lbs<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Devoted, Lively, Alert, Quick, Courageous<br><strong>Did you know:</strong> Chihuahua is the fourth-most popular dog breed by registrations (107,114) worldwide</p>
                     <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                     <p>The chihuahua is instinctively picky to whom he gives his affection. Once he has decided, he is firmly attached to his favorite and remains loyal when supplied by several - a true one-man or one-woman dog! If the Chihuahua has contact with many people, he also makes himself lovable to them. If his height matched his loyalty, the unexpectedly robust Chihuahua would be the ideal protector. Lively, alert, courageous and restless, he boldly and boldly faces the biggest dogs.</p><p>Chihuahuas, despite their size, need a consistent education like any dog. Especially the young Chihuahua is a true charmer in demanding attention. Too much coddled, he soon gives himself moody and obeys only reluctantly. But if you finally get it, he is very capable of learning and clever.</p>
                     <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                     <p>Documentary and archaeological evidence speaks in addition to China, Egypt and Malta predominantly for Mexico as a region of origin: Toltec and Aztecs considered this breed as domestic dogs. According to legend, chihuahuas did not only serve as sacred sacrificial animals, but were adored by Aztec chiefs because of their shining eyes and plump head to even follow him to the grave. According to legend, the Chihuahua showed him the way through the Underworld to paradise if the owner treated him well during his lifetime.</p><p>In the US, the Chihuahuas were discovered in the mid-19th century as charming, lively playmates, bred and developed their racial status. Soon the little dogs spread from there all over the world. Rosina V. Casselli attempted a first description of the breed in 1904 in the magazine Our Dogs, a variety artist who trained Chihuahuas for her performances. Since its first registration in the US studbook in the same year and the first standard of 1923, the appearance of the breed has been consolidated. Germany got to know and love Chihuahua comparatively late - the first dogs were registered in 1956.</p>

                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 10 – 12 years<br><strong>Litter size:</strong> 6–8 puppies<br><strong>Coat:</strong> Smooth, short and close<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Tenacious, Friendly, Affectionate, Devoted, Sweet-Tempered, Gentle<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Female: 44–60 lbs (20–27 Kg), Male: 51–64 lbs (23–29 Kg)<br><strong>Colors:</strong> White &amp; Chocolate, Blue Belton, Tri-color, Black &amp; Brown, Lemon &amp; White, Red &amp; White</p>
                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Basset Hound is a calm and balanced dog in the house, who convinces as a family or companion dog with his unobtrusive behavior. He also behaves generally friendly to strangers. In dealing with his owner or his family, he shows affectionate and meek. However, the former self-hunted Basset Hound has preserved a certain independence until today and therefore special emphasis must be placed on a consistent education.</p><p>The Basset Hound is a strong and enduring dog that has retained its good qualities as a hunting dog to this day. Particularly noteworthy is his excellent sense of smell, which allows the Basset Hound to work reliably and persistently in welding work. Although he is not a fast dog, the Basset Hound still shows a good hunting instinct and an outstanding endurance. Especially in the hare hunting, he is able to persist the small game persistently over a long period of time. Even a Basset Hound, which is kept as a family or companion dog, requires a lot of daily movement and enjoys the freewheel. Only with the appropriate amount of exercise will he prove to be a calm and well-balanced dog in the house.</p><p>With its elongated body and good-natured expression, the Basset Hound seems rather droll at first glance. His character also matches the outward appearance: Balanced, good-natured and sometimes stubborn, the Basset Hound enriches family life with its loveable nature. His leisurely manner may sometimes obscure his true origin, the hunt. To this day, the Basset Hound has retained both its hunting instinct and a surprising joy of movement.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>The Basset Hound is originally from France, where it was probably bred by monks as a hunting dog in the Middle Ages. The ancestors of the Basset Hounds are the now extinct Basset d'Artois and the Basset Artésien Normand, which arrived in England in the second half of the 19th century. Also, a bloodhound was crossed in 1892 to improve the sense of smell of the breed. Outside of the UK, the basset hound spread then especially in the US, where he was bred in the meantime as a pure fashion dog with over-emphasized breed characteristics. In the meantime, emphasis is again placed on balanced breeding.</p>

                           <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                           <p>The nature of the dachshund is friendly, it is neither fearful nor aggressive to describe. Overall, he is a persistent, passionate and nimble hunting dog. Characteristic of the Dachshund is the pronounced self-confidence, which makes him a skilful hunting dog. After all, dachshunds are designed to hunt badgers or foxes above and below ground. Here, the dog must have a good deal of self-confidence, because he meets defensive animals, also he can not count underground the aid of the hunter. The training and education of the Dachshund requires consistency and attention. Already in the puppy age should be started with a consistent training.</p>
                           <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                           <p>The ancestor of the modern dachshund is the Celtic hound. Already some 2,000 years ago, the Celtic tribes valued Bracken as faithful companions on the hunt. Also in Roman records from the 2nd century AD the dachshund finds mention. The short-legged animals were already known for their special hunting skills. In the Middle Ages, the predecessors of the Dachshund were used to hunt badgers and foxes to prevent crop losses and to protect domestic chickens. The small farm dogs were able to penetrate into the building and go hunting there. Bracken were selectively bred to better meet these requirements. For the animal to dig as effectively as possible and move quickly underground, short legs and a squat body were important.</p><p>During this time also the breed names, which are still used today, were created: Dachshund and Teckel. In 1879 the first race marks were defined and one year later the German Teckelclub was founded. At the beginning of the 19th century, the dachshund also spread outside Germany, 1925 followed by the first international standards.</p>
                           <h4>Racial Features:</h4>
                           <p>The Cynological Federation Fédération Cynologique Internationale places the Dachshund in the group of Dachshunds (Group 4). The currently valid definition describes the physique of the dachshund as low, short and compact. Despite the unusual relationship between body length and leg length, the dachshund is generally nimble and agile.</p><p>In addition, there are numerous color variations, even multicolored or brindle dachshunds are bred. In addition to the three types of hair, short-hair, longhair and roughhair, a distinction is made according to FCI Standard No. 148 between Teckel (chest circumference over 35 centimeters, weight about 9 kilograms), Zwergteckel (chest circumference 30 to 35 centimeters) and Kaninchenteckel (chest circumference up to 30 centimeters).</p>
