                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Life span:</strong> 10 – 12 years<br><strong>Origin:</strong> England<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Good-natured, Affectionate, Dignified, Protective, Calm, Courageous<br><strong>Height:</strong> Female: 70–91 cm, Male: 70–91 cm<br><strong>Weight:</strong> Female: 54–77 Kg, Male: 73–100 Kg<br><strong>Colors:</strong> Brindle, Fawn, Apricot</p>

                        <p>The Mastiff is an attentive observer, which often makes him a guardian of large estates in his native England. When faced with new situations, he is reluctant and will wait until his reactions are well considered. This behavior is often interpreted by ignorant people as anxiety, but on the contrary, its high stimulus threshold and the defensive nature attributed. Unnecessary aggression is completely alien to the Mastiff, making him an excellent family pet, who understands himself especially well with older people and children. He shows his special charm when he observes something attentively and folds his brow.</p><p>The strong relationship with his family makes him an excellent home or domestic dog, which is in no way suitable for keeping kennels. Due to its high stimulus threshold, he encounters possible threats with calm composure and without exaggerated aggressiveness. In case of a possible threat to his people, he will set the attacker, but never attack him if this is not necessary.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>
                        <p>Previously used as a war or hunting dog, the mastiff is nowadays only used as a companion, family or guard dog. As a family dog, he convinces with his calm, kind and easy-going manner. In addition, he gets on well with children and other pets. Even under stress and hectic, he keeps his calm. He feels most comfortable in a house with a garden, where he can play and romp uninhibited. But he is not averse to long walks. As a guard and guard dog, he exhibits a watchful and observant behavior and will not react until after he has fully assessed the situation.</p>

                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Chow Chow is a calm, but self-confident dog with a very original character. Like many Asian races, he is more independent and can therefore put his owner in the education of some tasks.

                        <p>he ancestors of Chow Chow have probably found their way to China from Mongolia and Siberia. In his homeland, the Chow Chow has many names and is called due to its appearance, for example, "puffed lion dog", "Wolfhound" or "bear dog". He is one of the original dog breeds whose history can be traced back to the eleventh century BC. </p><p>He was used mainly as a sled dog and in hunting, but was also used for other tasks such as herding cattle. In 1880, the first specimens came to Europe and 1887 was started in England with the breed. Only a few years later, the breed was then recognized and was also very popular at the English royal court.</p>

                        <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Life span:</strong> 8 – 10 years<br><strong>Weight: Male:</strong> 60–70 Kg, Female: 45–55 Kg<br><strong>Height: Male:</strong> 69–74 cm, Female: 63–69 cm<br><strong>Temperament:</strong> Sweet-Tempered, Gentle, Trainable<br><strong>Colors:</strong> Black, Blue Belton, Brown<br><strong>Origin:</strong> Canada, England</p>
                        <h4>Nature and Character:</h4>
                        <p>The Newfoundland has a very good-natured and affectionate nature. He demonstrates his kindness and gentleness above all as a family dog, and the majestic animals are also very calm and considerate to children. They also get along well with other pets, if they are given the opportunity early to get used to living together. The affectionate animals are also very dependent and seek the constant proximity to their owner or their family. For this reason, they are not particularly suitable for kennel keeping, but rather ideal companion for people with plenty of time and enjoy outdoor activities. Despite his serene nature, the Newfoundlander also shows himself as an enterprising and happy animal with an innate love of the water, a trait that has already characterized his Canadian ancestors. Despite their intelligence and comprehension, however, Newfoundlanders are less accessible if they are required to be strictly obedient.</p>
                        <h4>Origin and History:</h4>

It was created from crosses of native dogs and the black bear dog, introduced by the Vikings from 1100 race. European breeds brought to Newfoundland by European fishermen also influenced the development of the Newfoundland. At the beginning of colonization in 1610, the Newfoundland already showed its essential characteristics. He was subsequently used both as a train dog for transporting heavy loads and as a rescue and water dog. Above all, the breed was characterized by its insensitivity to extreme climatic conditions as well as by the innate preference for waters.</p>
